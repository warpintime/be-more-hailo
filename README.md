</p>

A fork of [@brenpoly's be-more-agent](https://github.com/brenpoly/be-more-agent) project, built to run fully on-device on a **Raspberry Pi 5** with the **Raspberry Pi AI HAT 2+** (Hailo-10H). BMO listens for its wake word, understands what you say, thinks about it locally, and talks back — no cloud, no subscriptions, no data leaving your house.

This fork adds a browser-based **web interface**, a shared `core/` module layer used by both interfaces, and updated support for the Hailo NPU hardware.

## What runs where

| Component | Where it runs | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| LLM (`qwen2.5-instruct:1.5b`) | Hailo-10H NPU | via `hailo-ollama` |
| Vision (`qwen2-vl-instruct:2b`) | Hailo-10H NPU | optional; requires camera |
| STT (Whisper base.en) | CPU | via `whisper.cpp`; NPU path causes PCIe timeouts |
| TTS (Piper) | CPU | streams sentence-by-sentence while LLM generates |
| Wake word (openWakeWord) | CPU | "Hey BMO" custom model |

STT runs on the CPU by design. Pushing 16kHz audio arrays through the Hailo PCIe bus caused consistent 15+ second timeouts during development. `whisper.cpp` on the quad-core ARM is fast enough and keeps the NPU free for inference.

---

## Interfaces

### On-Device (`agent_hailo.py`)
BMO in its natural habitat. Plug in a screen, a USB mic, and a USB speaker and you get the full experience: animated faces, wake word detection, and the whole listen → think → speak loop running locally. After each response, BMO stays in "Still listening..." mode for 8 seconds so you can keep a conversation going without re-saying the wake word every time.

### Web (`web_app.py`)
A FastAPI server with a browser-based UI — useful if you want to talk to BMO from another room, or you'd rather not have a screen hanging off your Pi. Hold a button to record, and BMO responds with audio in your browser.

The web interface includes:
- **Debug panel** — conversation history and live server logs
- **Pronunciation override** — corrects how Piper pronounces specific words
- **LLM status indicator** — shows whether the NPU model is ready
- **Hands-free mode** — enables wake word detection so you don't need to hold the button
- **Pi Audio toggle** — routes audio to the Pi's physical speaker instead of browser playback

---

## Secure remote access

Modern browsers require HTTPS for microphone access, which makes things awkward when your Pi is just sitting on your local network. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) solves this elegantly — install it on your Pi and your other devices, enable HTTPS certificates, and you get a proper `*.ts.net` address with a real cert, reachable from anywhere on your Tailnet. No port forwarding, no dynamic DNS nonsense.

> **Disclosure:** I work at Tailscale. That said, I genuinely use it for this project and it's the best solution I've found for exactly this problem.

1. Install Tailscale on the Pi and your client device
2. Enable [HTTPS certificates](https://tailscale.com/kb/1153/enabling-https/) in the Tailscale admin console
3. On the Pi, run:
   ```bash
   tailscale serve --bg --https=443 localhost:8080
   ```
4. Access the web UI at `https://<your-pi-hostname>.ts.net`

Your BMO is then reachable from your phone, laptop, or any device on your Tailnet — mic access works, and it's not exposed to the open internet.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit, current stable)
- `hailo-ollama` installed and running — follow [Hailo's documentation](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-ollama) for setup

### Automated install

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moorew/be-more-hailo/main/setup.sh | bash
cd be-more-agent
```

The script handles everything:
- Installs system packages including `libcamera-apps` for camera support
- Downloads and extracts the Piper TTS engine
- Clones and compiles `whisper.cpp`
- Downloads the `ggml-base.en` Whisper model
- Creates a Python virtual environment and installs dependencies
- Pulls `qwen2.5-instruct:1.5b` (LLM) and `qwen2-vl-instruct:2b` (vision) via `hailo-ollama`
- Checks camera availability and lets you know if anything's missing

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moorew/be-more-hailo.git be-more-agent
cd be-more-agent
chmod +x *.sh
./setup.sh
```

---

## Running

## Running

**Web Interface (Kiosk Mode):**
```bash
./setup_web.sh
```
This script installs all necessary Python and system audio dependencies, sets up the `bmo-web.service` to start on boot, and configures Chromium to automatically open in full-screen kiosk mode on desktop login.

To manually start/stop the web backend: `sudo systemctl start|stop|restart bmo-web`
To run manually without the service: `. venv/bin/activate && ./start_web.sh`

**On-device GUI (Tkinter):**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
./start_agent.sh
```

**Auto-start LLM & GUI Services:**
```bash
./setup_services.sh
```
Then manage with `sudo systemctl start|stop|restart bmo-ollama` or `bmo-gui`.

---

## Configuration

All settings live in `core/config.py`. The most commonly changed values:

```python
# LLM models (must be pulled via hailo-ollama)
LLM_MODEL       = "qwen2.5-instruct:1.5b"
FAST_LLM_MODEL  = "qwen2.5-instruct:1.5b"
VISION_MODEL    = "qwen2-vl-instruct:2b"

# Audio device for local hardware playback (run `aplay -l` to find yours)
# The USB speaker is typically on a different ALSA card from the mic — check both.
ALSA_DEVICE = "plughw:UACDemoV10,0"

# Microphone device index (run `python3 -c "import sounddevice as sd; print(sd.query_devices())"`)
MIC_DEVICE_INDEX = 1
MIC_SAMPLE_RATE  = 48000

# STT binary and model
WHISPER_CMD   = "./whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-cli"
WHISPER_MODEL = "./models/ggml-base.en.bin"
```

Environment variables override any of these at runtime:
```bash
export ALSA_DEVICE="plughw:2,0"
```

---

## Dual-model routing

By default, all queries go to a single model (`qwen2.5-instruct:1.5b`). If you want to route longer or more complex queries to a larger model:

1. Pull the larger model via `hailo-ollama`
2. Set `LLM_MODEL` to the larger model name in `core/config.py`
3. Keep `FAST_LLM_MODEL` pointing to `qwen2.5-instruct:1.5b`

Short, simple prompts (under 15 words, no complex keywords) stay on the fast model. Longer or more complex ones go to `LLM_MODEL`. Note that swapping models on the Hailo-10H takes a few seconds on the first query after a switch.

---

## Camera and vision

If you have a Raspberry Pi Camera Module connected:

1. Enable the camera interface in `raspi-config`
2. Install camera tools if not already present:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y libcamera-apps
   ```
3. Say something like "Hey BMO, take a photo and tell me what you see" — the agent captures a frame with `rpicam-still` and sends it to the vision model (`qwen2-vl-instruct:2b`) on the NPU

If no camera is found, BMO will say so rather than crashing.

---

## Customisation

BMO is pretty easy to make your own:

**Personality:** Edit `get_system_prompt()` in `core/config.py`. This is where BMO's voice, tone, and quirks are defined.

**Faces:** BMO's faces are procedurally generated by `generate_faces.py` using 4x supersampling for perfectly smooth, anti-aliased lines. Run `python generate_faces.py` to regenerate all 74 frames across 13 expression states. The generator precisely matches the original BMO art style — pixel-accurate eye positions, rounded line caps, and correct interior mouth colours.

**Expressions:** The LLM can trigger any expression by outputting `{"action": "set_expression", "value": "happy"}`. Available emotions:

| Expression | Description |
|---|---|
| `happy` | Upturned arc eyes with a bouncing smile |
| `sad` | Downturned slash eyes with a frown that droops |
| `angry` | Crossed slash eyes with a flat trembling mouth |
| `surprised` | Big round eyes with a pulsing O-shaped mouth |
| `sleepy` | Closed eyes with floating Z letters |
| `dizzy` | X-shaped eyes with a wavy squiggle mouth |
| `cheeky` | One open eye, one winking, wagging tongue |
| `heart` | Beating heart-shaped eyes (scales up and down) |
| `starry_eyed` | Spinning 4-point sparkle stars for eyes |
| `confused` | One oversized eye, one flat line, wiggly mouth |
| `daydream` | Eyes drifted up with floating thought bubbles *(screensaver)* |
| `bored` | Eyes shifting left and right *(screensaver)* |
| `jamming` | Closed eyes, big smile, bouncing musical notes *(screensaver)* |
| `curious` | One eye pulsing larger than the other, tilted look *(screensaver)* |

**Sounds:** Put `.wav` files in `sounds/<category>/`. BMO picks one at random per event.

**Wake word:** Replace `wakeword.onnx` with any [OpenWakeWord](https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord)-compatible model.

---

## Screensaver personality

When BMO has been idle for 60 seconds, it enters screensaver mode and cycles through its expressions. Approximately every **30 minutes**, BMO will "think out loud" by:

1. Searching the web for a random topic (weather, news, fun facts, quotes, science, jokes)
2. Feeding the search result to the on-device LLM with a special prompt
3. Speaking the generated thought via Piper TTS

BMO stays quiet during:
- **Night hours** (10 PM – 8 AM)
- **Recent interaction** (within 60 seconds of your last conversation)

This all runs locally — search results go through DuckDuckGo and the LLM processes them on the Hailo NPU.
