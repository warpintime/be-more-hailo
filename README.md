A fork of [@brenpoly's be-more-agent](https://github.com/brenpoly/be-more-agent) project, built to run fully on-device on a **Raspberry Pi 5** with the **Raspberry Pi AI HAT 2+** (Hailo-10H). BMO listens for its wake word, understands what you say, thinks about it locally, and talks back — no cloud, no subscriptions, no data leaving your house.

This fork adds a browser-based **web interface**, a shared `core/` module layer used by both interfaces, and updated support for the Hailo NPU hardware.

## What runs where

| Component | Where it runs | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| LLM (`qwen2.5-instruct:1.5b`) | Hailo-10H NPU | via `hailo-ollama` |
| Vision (`Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct`) | Hailo-10H NPU | via HailoRT Python API; optional, requires camera |
| STT (Whisper base.en) | CPU | via `whisper.cpp`; NPU path causes PCIe timeouts |
| TTS (Piper) | CPU | streams sentence-by-sentence while LLM generates |
| Wake word (openWakeWord) | CPU | "Hey BMO" custom model |

STT runs on the CPU by design. Pushing 16kHz audio arrays through the Hailo PCIe bus caused consistent 15+ second timeouts during development. `whisper.cpp` on the quad-core ARM is fast enough and keeps the NPU free for inference.

---

## Interfaces

### On-Device (`agent_hailo.py`)
BMO in its natural habitat. Plug in a screen, a USB mic, and a USB speaker and you get the full experience: animated faces, wake word detection, and the whole listen → think → speak loop running locally. After each response, BMO stays in "Still listening..." mode for 8 seconds so you can keep a conversation going without re-saying the wake word every time.

### Web (`web_app.py`)
A FastAPI server with a browser-based UI — useful if you want to talk to BMO from another room, or you'd rather not have a screen hanging off your Pi. Hold a button to record, and BMO responds with audio in your browser.

The web interface includes:
- **Debug panel** — conversation history and live server logs
- **Pronunciation override** — corrects how Piper pronounces specific words
- **LLM status indicator** — shows whether the NPU model is ready
- **Hands-free mode** — enables wake word detection so you don't need to hold the button
- **Browser audio playback** — generated speech plays back directly in the web client

---

## Secure remote access

Modern browsers require HTTPS for microphone access, which makes things awkward when your Pi is just sitting on your local network. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) solves this elegantly — install it on your Pi and your other devices, enable HTTPS certificates, and you get a proper `*.ts.net` address with a real cert, reachable from anywhere on your Tailnet. No port forwarding, no dynamic DNS nonsense.

> **Disclosure:** I work at Tailscale. That said, I genuinely use it for this project and it's the best solution I've found for exactly this problem.

1. Install Tailscale on the Pi and your client device
2. Enable [HTTPS certificates](https://tailscale.com/kb/1153/enabling-https/) in the Tailscale admin console
3. On the Pi, run:
   ```bash
   tailscale serve --bg --https=443 localhost:8080
   ```
4. Access the web UI at `https://<your-pi-hostname>.ts.net`

Your BMO is then reachable from your phone, laptop, or any device on your Tailnet — mic access works, and it's not exposed to the open internet.

---

## Web App / PWA mode

The practical mobile path for this project is to treat the browser as the client UI and keep inference on the Pi or another server. The original stack depends on Linux-only pieces like HailoRT, `hailo-ollama`, ALSA audio playback, Piper CLI, and `whisper.cpp`, so this repo does not try to run the full AI pipeline natively on a phone or tablet.

The web UI is set up to work as an installable web app:
- Open the HTTPS URL in a modern browser
- Use your browser's install or **Add to Home Screen** action
- Launch BMO in standalone mode

This gives you:
- Full-screen app-style launch on mobile
- Mobile-safe layout and larger touch controls
- Browser-friendly microphone recording
- PWA install metadata and cached UI shell

If you later want a real native mobile app, the next step is a separate client that talks to the existing backend API:
- `/api/chat`
- `/api/transcribe`
- `/api/status`
- `/api/faces/{state}`
- `/api/sounds/{category}`

---

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB or 8GB recommended)
- Raspberry Pi AI HAT 2+ (Hailo-10H, required for NPU features)
- USB microphone and speaker (for on-device mode)
- HDMI or DSI display (for on-device GUI)
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module (optional, for vision/photo features)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit, current stable)
- `hailo-h10-all` installed — the setup script handles this, but if installing manually: `sudo apt install hailo-h10-all`
- `hailo-ollama` — the setup script builds this from source automatically. If installing manually, see [hailo_model_zoo_genai](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo_model_zoo_genai)

### Automated install

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moorew/be-more-hailo/main/setup.sh | bash
cd be-more-agent
```

The script handles everything:
- Installs system packages including `libcamera-apps` for camera support
- Fixes the Hailo driver conflict (blacklists the legacy `hailo_pci` module)
- Builds and installs `hailo-ollama` from source if not already present
- Downloads and extracts the Piper TTS engine
- Clones and compiles `whisper.cpp`
- Downloads the `ggml-base.en` Whisper model
- Creates a Python virtual environment and installs dependencies
- Pulls `qwen2.5-instruct:1.5b` (LLM) via `hailo-ollama`
- Downloads the `Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct` VLM HEF directly from Hailo's CDN (~2.2 GB)
- Enables system site-packages in the venv so Python can use `hailo_platform`
- Checks camera availability and lets you know if anything's missing

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moorew/be-more-hailo.git be-more-agent
cd be-more-agent
chmod +x *.sh
./setup.sh
```

---

## Running

**Web Interface (Kiosk Mode):**
```bash
./setup_web.sh
```
This script installs all necessary Python and system audio dependencies, sets up the `bmo-web.service` to start on boot, and configures Chromium to automatically open in full-screen kiosk mode on desktop login.

To manually start/stop the web backend: `sudo systemctl start|stop|restart bmo-web`
To run manually without the service: `. venv/bin/activate && ./start_web.sh`

**On-device GUI (Tkinter):**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
./start_agent.sh
```

**Auto-start LLM & GUI Services:**
```bash
./setup_services.sh
```
Then manage with `sudo systemctl start|stop|restart bmo-ollama` or `bmo-gui`.

---

## Configuration

All settings live in `core/config.py`. The most commonly changed values:

```python
# LLM models (must be pulled via hailo-ollama)
LLM_MODEL       = "qwen2.5-instruct:1.5b"
FAST_LLM_MODEL  = "qwen2.5-instruct:1.5b"

# Vision model — runs directly via HailoRT Python API (not hailo-ollama)
VLM_HEF_PATH    = "./models/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct.hef"

# Audio device for local hardware playback (run `aplay -l` to find yours)
# The USB speaker is typically on a different ALSA card from the mic — check both.
ALSA_DEVICE = "plughw:UACDemoV10,0"

# Microphone device index (run `python3 -c "import sounddevice as sd; print(sd.query_devices())"`)
MIC_DEVICE_INDEX = 1
MIC_SAMPLE_RATE  = 48000

# STT binary and model
WHISPER_CMD   = "./whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-cli"
WHISPER_MODEL = "./models/ggml-base.en.bin"
```

Environment variables override any of these at runtime:
```bash
export ALSA_DEVICE="plughw:2,0"
```

---

## Dual-model routing

By default, all queries go to a single model (`qwen2.5-instruct:1.5b`). If you want to route longer or more complex queries to a larger model:

1. Pull the larger model via `hailo-ollama`
2. Set `LLM_MODEL` to the larger model name in `core/config.py`
3. Keep `FAST_LLM_MODEL` pointing to `qwen2.5-instruct:1.5b`

Short, simple prompts (under 15 words, no complex keywords) stay on the fast model. Longer or more complex ones go to `LLM_MODEL`. Note that swapping models on the Hailo-10H takes a few seconds on the first query after a switch.

---

## Camera and vision

If you have a Raspberry Pi Camera Module connected:

1. Enable the camera interface in `raspi-config`
2. Install camera tools if not already present:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y libcamera-apps
   ```
3. Say something like "Hey BMO, take a photo and tell me what you see" — the agent captures a frame with `rpicam-still` and sends it to the vision model (`Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct`) running natively on the NPU via the HailoRT Python API

The VLM runs as a separate process from the LLM server. Hailo's VDevice sharing allows both to coexist on the same NPU without conflicts. If the VLM HEF file isn't installed, BMO will politely say so rather than crashing.

---

## Customisation

BMO is pretty easy to make your own:

**Personality:** Edit `get_system_prompt()` in `core/config.py`. This is where BMO's voice, tone, and quirks are defined.

**Faces:** BMO's faces are procedurally generated by `generate_faces.py` using 4x supersampling for perfectly smooth, anti-aliased lines. Run `python generate_faces.py` to regenerate all 74 frames across 13 expression states. The generator precisely matches the original BMO art style — pixel-accurate eye positions, rounded line caps, and correct interior mouth colours.

**Expressions:** The LLM can trigger any expression by outputting `{"action": "set_expression", "value": "happy"}`. Available emotions:

| Expression | Description |
|---|---|
| `happy` | Upturned arc eyes with a bouncing smile |
| `sad` | Downturned slash eyes with a frown that droops |
| `angry` | Crossed slash eyes with a flat trembling mouth |
| `surprised` | Big round eyes with a pulsing O-shaped mouth |
| `sleepy` | Closed eyes with floating Z letters |
| `dizzy` | X-shaped eyes with a wavy squiggle mouth |
| `cheeky` | One open eye, one winking, wagging tongue |
| `heart` | Beating heart-shaped eyes (scales up and down) |
| `starry_eyed` | Spinning 4-point sparkle stars for eyes |
| `confused` | One oversized eye, one flat line, wiggly mouth |
| `daydream` | Eyes drifted up with floating thought bubbles *(screensaver)* |
| `bored` | Eyes shifting left and right *(screensaver)* |
| `jamming` | Closed eyes, big smile, bouncing musical notes *(screensaver)* |
| `curious` | One eye pulsing larger than the other, tilted look *(screensaver)* |

**Sounds:** Put `.wav` files in `sounds/<category>/`. BMO picks one at random per event.

**Wake word:** Replace `wakeword.onnx` with any [OpenWakeWord](https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord)-compatible model.

---

## Screensaver personality

When BMO has been idle for 60 seconds, it enters screensaver mode and cycles through its expressions. Approximately every **30 minutes**, BMO will "think out loud" by:

1. Searching the web for a random topic (weather, news, fun facts, quotes, science, jokes)
2. Feeding the search result to the on-device LLM with a special prompt
3. Speaking the generated thought via Piper TTS

BMO stays quiet during:
- **Night hours** (10 PM – 8 AM)
- **Recent interaction** (within 60 seconds of your last conversation)

This all runs locally — search results go through DuckDuckGo and the LLM processes them on the Hailo NPU.

---

## Troubleshooting

**LLM shows as offline / can't connect to port 8000**

Check if `hailo-ollama` is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status bmo-ollama
```
If the service isn't set up yet, start it manually:
```bash
export OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:8000
hailo-ollama serve
```
If `hailo-ollama` isn't found, re-run `./setup.sh` — it will build and install it from source.

**Hailo NPU not detected (`/dev/hailo0` missing)**

This is usually caused by a driver conflict. The system ships with both `hailo_pci` (Hailo-8) and `hailo1x_pci` (Hailo-10H) drivers. If the old one loads first, it blocks the new one from creating the device node. Fix it by blacklisting the old driver:
```bash
echo "blacklist hailo_pci" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-hailo-legacy.conf
sudo rmmod hailo1x_pci 2>/dev/null; sudo rmmod hailo_pci 2>/dev/null
sudo modprobe hailo1x_pci
ls /dev/hailo0  # should now exist
```
The setup script handles this automatically, but if you installed manually you may need to do it yourself.

**Inference fails with `HAILO_OUT_OF_PHYSICAL_DEVICES`**

This means `/dev/hailo0` doesn't exist — see the fix above. Another cause is a process already holding the device; check with `lsof /dev/hailo0`.

**VLM fails with `HAILO_INVALID_OPERATION` / `HailoRTStatusException: 6`**

This usually means the VLM HEF file was compiled for a different HailoRT version. The HEF must match your installed runtime:
```bash
dpkg -l | grep hailort  # check your version (e.g. 5.1.1)
```
Re-download the matching HEF:
```bash
HAILORT_VER=$(dpkg-query -W -f='${Version}' h10-hailort)
wget -O models/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct.hef \
    "https://dev-public.hailo.ai/v${HAILORT_VER}/blob/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct.hef"
```

**Camera vision says "my eyes aren't working"**

If the VLM HEF is present but inference still fails, check that `hailo_platform` is importable:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -c "from hailo_platform.genai import VLM; print('OK')"
```
If it fails, ensure system site-packages are enabled: `grep include-system venv/pyvenv.cfg` should say `true`.
